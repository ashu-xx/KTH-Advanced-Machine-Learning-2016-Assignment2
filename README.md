# Machine Learning


The project includes implementation of Graphical models, Variational Inference and Expectation Maximization as well as mathematical derivations for some of them. This is a compilation of my solution for assignment 2 in KTH's Advanced-Machine-Learning-2016 course.
All the codes are in python and mathematical derivation are written in Latex.
I used ipython for development and directly downloaded the notebooks in .py files for uploading here, so it is possible that 
you might need to rewrite a few lines to get it working properly. You may also need to refer the book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher Bishop in some questions
